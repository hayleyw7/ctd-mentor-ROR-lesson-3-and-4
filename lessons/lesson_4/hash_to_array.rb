# Program 3

# Write a program that collects 5 keys and 5 values from the user, and stores them in a hash.  Write a method that accepts the hash as a parameter and prints out an array of keys and an array of values.  Call the method within your program so you know it works. (Question: Can you find online information on Ruby hash methods that will help with this method?)  Call this program `hash_to_array.rb`.
