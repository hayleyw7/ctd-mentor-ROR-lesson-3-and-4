# Program 2

# Write a program `hangman.rb` that contains a method called `hangman`.  The method's parameters are a word and an array of letters.  It returns a string showing the letters that have been guessed.  Call the method several times from within your program, testing with different words and strings, and printing out what is returned, so that you know that your hangman method works.

  # Example: `hangman("bob", ["b"])` should return `"b_b"`
  # Example: `hangman("alphabet", ["a", "h"])` should return `"a__ha___"`
